Note: This modified version of teddykoker/pedalnet is IN WORK. 
       Goals are to create a plugin to use in a DAW from the trained models,
       either by converting the model to the the WaveNetVA repo format,
       or by generating a deployable Pytorch model from Pedalnet. 
       Also added plot_wav.py, which is intended to analyze the wav files
       generated from test.py. 


# PedalNet

Re-creation of model from [Real-Time Guitar Amplifier Emulation with Deep
Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/766/htm)

See my [blog
post](http://teddykoker.com/2020/05/deep-learning-for-guitar-effect-emulation/)
for a more in depth description along with song demos.

## Data

`data/in.wav` - Concatenation of a few samples from the
[IDMT-SMT-Guitar](https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en/business_units/m2d/smt/guitar.html) dataset<br>
`data/ts9_out.wav` - Recorded output of `in.wav` after being passed through an
Ibanez TS9 Tube Screamer (all knobs at 12 o'clock).<br>
`models/pedalnet.ckpt` - Pretrained model weights


## Usage

**Run effect on .wav file**:
Must be single channel, 44.1 kHz
```bash
# must be same data used to train
python prepare_data.py data/in.wav data/out_ts9.wav 

# specify input file and desired output file
python predict.py my_input_guitar.wav my_output.wav 

# if you trained you own model you can pass --model flag
# with path to .ckpt
```

**Train**:
```bash
python prepare_data.py data/in.wav data/out_ts9.wav # or use your own!
python train.py 
python train.py --gpus "0,1"  # for multiple gpus
python train.py -h  # help (see for other hyperparameters)
```

**Test**:
```bash
python test.py # test pretrained model
python test.py --model lightning_logs/version_{X}/epoch={EPOCH}.ckpt  # test trained model
```
Creates files `y_test.wav`, `y_pred.wav`, and `x_test.wav`, for the ground truth
output, predicted output, and input signal respectively.
